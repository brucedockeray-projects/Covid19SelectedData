    <p>Its all a bit doomy and gloomy. The UK just announced its highest ever daily number of positive Coronavirus tests (6,634). Morrisons announced it was putting in place measures to limit panic buying of certain items such as toilet rolls. Students who have just arrived at University might be forbidden from returning home. Pubs and restaurants have to close at 10.00pm and its table service only. Track and trace is mandatory. Mask wearing is mandatory for inside spaces,although there are various exceptions. Quarantine for 14 days is necessary if you arrive in the UK from many other countries (the European list includes,inter alia,Spain,France,Netherlands,Iceland,Denmark).</p>
<p>And the Schools have just gone back and UK Universities are currently just going back or are in the throes of Freshers week. Scottish Universities started earlier in September - today Glasgow University has an outbreak of 120+ cases in their Halls of Residence. Are Halls of Residence going to be the new Cruise Ships? English Universities could easily follow. Although we are told young people have little to fear fron catching the Virus HOW keen are they to catch it. </p>
<p>And we have the rule of 6. In England there is a maximum of six people allowed to gather,indoors or out. In Scotland households are not allowed to visit each other.</p>
<p>The Virus hasn't heard the message that we have had enough of living like hermits. It hasn't gone away. </p>
<p>Despite all of this we are far from the total lockdown earlier this year. The roads are busy. People are out and about. shops are open. Children are going to School. Most businesses have reopened even though, sadly, many of our places of entertainment remain closed and sport is now playing behind closed doors.  </p>
<h2>Update 13th October 2020</h2>
<p>Numbers of daily infections around 14,000. ONS survey data (in conjuction with Oxford Uni) indicates that England had an overall infection rate of 224,000 cases in the week to 1 October - equivalent to 1 in 240 people. Regions most affected were in the Nort East and North West. </p>
<p>Government has announced a three tier system. Only Liverpool, currently, is being placed on the highest (most restrictive) tier. Government is attempting to walk the tightrope of balancing economic activity with public health. </p>
<p>To be fair most people appear to be complying with rule of 6 and pubs, restaurants and stores are applying rules (although differences in interpretaion are a little amusing ) - nevertheless the virus spreads through social contact and the suppression of infection rates achieved earlier in the year was effective because everything ground to a halt. The economic and social fallout of that remedy has been deemed too costly so we are now, I suppose, being more swedish in our approach.</p>
<p>The recent increases in infection rates are tracking across Europe, perhaps because we are all experiencing colder weather and spending more time indoors. Germany, France and the Netherlands are all on similar trajectories. </p>
<p>All this and Brexit too. Blimey !  </p>
