    <p>It is becoming clear that a number of countries are either in total denial, or are massaging the figues, or both. These countries include Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Belarus. There may be others. </p>
<p>In general these are not wealthy countries. It may be that their economies are financially unable to cope with social distancing, it may be that politicians find it easier to pretend that everything is normal in preference to admitting to a crisis. In the fulness of time perhaps the truth will emerge, except that in a poor country, a corrupt system can cover up wrongdoing for a very long time. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is a mark of a mature democracy that it does disclose the truth even if the data doen't look good  - in this context the incorporation of care home and community deaths into the UK dataset is to be applauded despite the fact that its inclusion made the cumulative death count in the UK the worst in Europe!</p>
<h2>Belarus</h2>
<p>Meanwhile,despite the worldwide pandemic, Belarus had a full scale <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/uPWptWBoe1FPkebz5">military parade</a>to celebrate VE day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/thousands-turn-out-for-ve-day-parade-in-belarus-despite-covid-19-concerns">The Guardian reported</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>images from the parade showed packed crowds as the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, boasted of holding the only parade in the former Soviet Union to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>“In this insane, disoriented world, there will be people who condemn us for the time and place of this sacred act,” he said. “Don’t rush to conclusions or condemn us, descendants of the victory of Belarusians. We couldn’t have acted differently. We had no other choice. And even if we had one, we would have done the same.”</p>
<p>Lukashenko has publicly downplayed the pandemic, appearing at Orthodox Easter services and other public events and calling concerns over the virus a “psychosis”. Belarus is the only country in Europe to continue holding football matches during the crisis.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Brazil</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31095-3/fulltext">Lancet</a> in its article on Brazil's handling of the crisis identifies the Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro as the biggest threat.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When asked by journalists last week about the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, he responded: “So what? What do you want me to do?” He ... continues to sow confusion by openly flouting and discouraging the sensible measures of physical distancing and lockdown brought in by state governors and city mayors</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brazil’s provocateur president has continued to brush off the coronavirus, taking a spin on a jet-ski to a floating barbecue and attacking Covid-19 “neurosis” as his country’s death toll rose to more than 10,000.</p>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro has faced domestic and international condemnation for his dismissive attitude toward the pandemic. The rightwing populist continues to play down the disease despite the growing evidence of its deadly impact on Brazil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>see also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-52701524">BBC Hospitals in Brazil's São Paulo 'near collapse'</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mayor of Brazil's largest city, São Paulo, has said its health system could collapse as demand grows for emergency beds to deal with coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>Bruno Covas said the city's public hospitals had reached 90% capacity and could run out of space in two weeks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Foreign investors in Brazil’s stock and bond markets continue to withdraw money en masse from Latin America’s largest economy, frightened off by hard-right president Jair Bolsonaro even as investment returns to many other emerging markets.</p>
<p>Cross-border flows from Brazil have dwarfed those of most other emerging economies. Foreign investors took $11.8bn from Brazil’s stock market in the four months from February to May and $18.7bn from its bond market between February and April, the most recent month of available data, according to the Institute of International Finance, an industry association that gathers emerging market data</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Mexico</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mexico-city-underreporting-covid-19-deaths-sky-news-analysis-finds-11987235">Sky news</a> report that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a recent briefing, the country's president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told the nation: "What the world knows about Mexico is that we are taming the pandemic, and we are basically doing this because Mexican people are making a conscious effort."</p>
<p>But that has been dismissed by many dealing with the crisis as incorrect </p>
<p>An official within the government, but speaking anonymously, confirms the official figures are undercounting the actual mortality rate by a factor of at least five.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/world/americas/mexico-coronavirus-count.html">NY Times</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doctors in overwhelmed hospitals in Mexico City say the reality of the epidemic is being hidden from the country. In some hospitals, patients lie on the floor, splayed on mattresses. Elderly people are propped up on metal chairs because there are not enough beds, while patients are turned away to search for space in less-prepared hospitals. Many die while searching, several doctors said.</p>
<p>“It’s like we doctors are living in two different worlds,” said Dr. Giovanna Avila, who works at Hospital de Especialidades Belisario Domínguez. “One is inside of the hospital with patients dying all the time. And the other is when we walk out onto the streets and see people walking around, clueless of what is going on and how bad the situation really is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Russia</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned">The Guardian</a> reports queries over Russian statistics</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unofficial statistics raise questions about how Russia is counting the numbers of its people who have died from the disease.</p>
<p>The Guardian this week collected reports of 150 deaths among health workers in the UK when the country had recorded more than 28,000 deaths from the disease. When Italy reported that 100 medical workers had died, the country’s death toll had just surpassed 18,200.</p>
<p>The Russian list has 97 names for just 1,451 coronavirus deaths, indicating that either Russian health workers are dying at higher rates or that the country’s total death toll due to coronavirus may be underreported, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/77cd2cba-b0e2-4022-a265-e0a9a7930bda">FT</a> analysed the data and suggests the death toll is understated in Russia by 70 per cent </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s national death toll from coronavirus could be 70 per cent higher than the government’s official data show, as the Kremlin struggles to curb the spread of Covid-19 despite a seven-week long lockdown.</p>
<p>Russia has made it illegal to publish or discuss “fake news” about the pandemic in the country, a decision that critics say could be used to muzzle independent media reports that contradict the government’s official statements.</p>
